13	DATA PROTECTION  
13.1	This section 13 applies if You are a legal person. All applicable laws, rules, and regulations relating to the protection of privacy and data protection are referred to as “Data Protection Legislation”. “Personal Information” is defined as in the applicable Data Protection Legislation, or if no definition is provided, any personally identifiable information which is either (i) provided by You, or (ii) automatically collected through Trimble’s service on Your behalf. “Applicable”, in this context, means the Data Protection Legislation applicable to You at Your principal place of business or to Trimble at Trimble’s principal place of business, and such laws that Customer notifies Trimble in writing of that apply to the parties.
a)	Each party will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation that applies to it. This Section 13.1 is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party's obligations or rights under the applicable Data Protection Legislation.
b)	The parties acknowledge that: (i) when performing its obligations under this Agreement,  Trimble processes Personal Information on the Your behalf and (ii) the Personal Information may be transferred or stored, and/or accessed from outside of the country where Your principal place of business is located in order to provide the SaaS and Trimble's other obligations under this Agreement.
c)	Without prejudice to the generality of Section 13.1 a), You will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents and notices in place (i) to enable lawful transfer of the personal information to Trimble for the duration and purposes of the Agreement and (ii) to enable Trimble to lawfully use, process and transfer the Personal Information in accordance with this Agreement, including on Your behalf.
d)	If the processing of Personal Information by Trimble is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) or the Data Protection Act 2018 of the United Kingdom, then, in addition, at the request of Customer, then the parties will execute an applicable data processing addendum, see https://www.trimble.com/en/our-commitment/responsible-business/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy-center?tab=privacy_notice .
13.2	CCPA. If the processing of Personal Information by Trimble is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (Title 1.81.5, §1798.100 et. seq.) (“CCPA”), then in connection with a verified request by a data subject pursuant to an exercise of rights under CCPA related to Personal Information, Trimble is Customer’s service provider and Customer (and not Trimble) will respond to such request, and if necessary in connection with such verified request Customer will utilize the tools and information provided or made generally available by Trimble, such as Trimble’s online portals or APIs and standard documentation regarding Trimble’s products, software and services. To the extent such tools do not enable Customer to respond to a verified request, upon Customer’s request Trimble will provide reasonable assistance with respect to Personal information in Trimble’s systems that is required for Customer’s response to such request. A consumer request to delete Personal Information will not require Trimble to delete Personal Information required to provide Customer with the Product(s), which includes any of Trimble’s service provider(s) acting on Trimble’s behalf to provide the Product(s); provided, however, that such service provider(s) do not have a separate right to sell or use Customer’s Personal Information other than as required for Trimble’s business purposes.
14	General
14.1	Each Party undertakes to the other Party to keep confidential all Confidential Information that it has obtained or received as a result of entering into this EULA, and not to disclose such Confidential Information except on a strictly need-to-know basis to its employees, agents and subcontractors and those of Authorized Affiliates and Professional Consultants. The foregoing obligation shall not apply in respect of Confidential Information that is:

b)	in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this Clause 14.1.
14.2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall be entitled to disclose Confidential Information, where such disclosure is required pursuant to law, decree or order issued by competent authorities, or juridical order provided that such Party shall (i) only disclose such portion of the Confidential Information that is so required, (ii) inform the recipient of the Confidential Information that the information released is confidential and, where applicable, use its reasonable endeavors to ensure that the information is kept confidential by such recipient, and (iii) promptly notify the other Party of such release of Confidential Information, specifying the information disclosed, the recipient of the information, and the circumstances giving rise to the duty to disclose it.
14.3	Each Party undertakes to take all such steps as shall from time to time be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of Clause 14.1      by its employees, agents and subcontractors, and in case of You, also those of Your Affiliates or Professional Consultants.

The number of arbitrators in an arbitration procedure shall be one. The seat of arbitration shall be Helsinki, Finland. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The award shall be final and binding on the Parties and the Parties agree that the arbitration procedure and all thereto related material and information shall be treated as Confidential Information in accordance with the Clause 14.1. This Clause shall not preclude a Party from obtaining interim injunctive relief on an immediate basis from a court of competent jurisdiction where such relief is necessary to protect that Party’s interests in pending completion of the legal proceedings. Furthermore, Trimble may choose to claim for any undisputed, due and outstanding receivables at the district court of Espoo, Finland.
14.8	If any provision of this EULA shall be found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect any other provisions of this EULA and all provisions not affected by such invalidity or unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties hereby agree to attempt to substitute any invalid or unenforceable provision referred to above with a valid or enforceable provision which achieves the greatest extent possible the economic, legal and commercial objectives of the invalid or unenforceable provision. If the Parties are unable to agree upon substitute provision(s) referred to above, and the invalid or unenforceable provision(s) deprive(s) either Party from a substantial benefit originally envisaged by it, the affected Party has the right to terminate this EULA in writing with immediate effect.

14.10	Neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this EULA (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events which occur after the entry into force of this EULA and which are beyond the reasonable control of such Party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, insurrection, riot, fire, explosion, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, denial-of-service attack, embargo or refusal of a license by a government agency (an “event of force majeure”). In an event of force majeure, the other Party shall be notified without delay of its occurrence and estimated duration. If the performance of the EULA is delayed by more than three (3) months as a result of an event of force majeure, a Party may terminate the EULA by notifying the other Party in writing thereof.
14.11	The waiver by either Party of a breach or default of any of the provisions of this EULA shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or default in respect of such provisions, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either Party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power or privilege that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver of any breach or default by the other Party.
14.12	Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder shall be delivered or sent by pre-paid post, by fax, or other electronic means to the address of the receiving Party, and any such notice or other document shall be deemed to have been served, if delivered by courier, at the time of delivery, or, if sent by mail, two (2) days after dispatch.
